# Nutrient Data Extraction

Two GA primitives, two scripts. **`parse`** (`scripts/parse.py`) returns the whole-document
model — typed elements (paragraphs, tables, formulas, pictures, key-value regions,
handwriting) with bounding boxes, or clean whole-document Markdown. **`extract`**
(`scripts/extract.py`) returns just the fields you define in a JSON Schema, each grounded to a
page region by a per-field citation.

## Choosing parse vs extract

| The request is about… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Named target fields — "the invoice number and total", "these fields", "map to my schema", "with citations" | **`extract`** | One call returns your fields, cited — no need to walk every element |
| The whole document — "parse this", "whole-document Markdown", "chunk for embeddings", RAG, search indexing, migration | **`parse`** | Whole-document model / Markdown for open-ended retrieval |
| Every table / all key-value regions (no target schema) | **`parse`** (spatial) | Enumerate all elements; `extract` needs a schema of what to pull |

For RAG *chunking* of a parsed document, see the sibling `grounded-rag-ingestion` skill. For
PDF generation, conversion, OCR, redaction, signing, or any `/build`-based workflow, use the
sibling `document-processor-api` skill.

## When to use

- Extract known fields with citations (invoice number, totals, dates, parties) → **`extract`**.
- Build a RAG ingestion pipeline: PDF -> Markdown -> chunks -> embeddings → **`parse`**.
- Index content for search or migrate documents into a new CMS → **`parse`**.
- Reconstruct page layout, or run layout-aware understanding (semantic roles, table cell
  spans, formulas in LaTeX, picture alt descriptions) → **`parse`**.

<!-- Roadmap: /extraction/generate_schema, /classify, and /form exist but are internal preview
     (data_extraction_preview flag; 404 for public tenants) — not surfaced here yet. -->

## `/extraction/extract` — schema field extraction with citations

Define the fields you want in a JSON Schema (root `type: object`); `extract` returns
`output.data` with those values and `output.metadata` with a per-field citation grounding each
to a page region (`options.includeCitations` defaults on). Accepts a local file **or a URL**.

```bash
# Pull schema-defined fields from a local invoice, with citations (default)
uv run scripts/extract.py --input invoice.pdf --schema fields.json --out result.json

# From a URL, higher-accuracy mode, persist the run
uv run scripts/extract.py --url https://example.com/form.pdf --schema fields.json \
  --out result.json --mode understand --store-run
```

Cost: `extract` bills the chosen parse mode **plus a flat +6 credits/page** (structure 7.5,
understand 15, agentic 24 cr/page). Extract has no `text` mode — the cheapest path is `structure`.
The script prints the server's authoritative
usage after the call and gates high estimates behind `--yes`. See
`references/extract-output-and-citations.md` for the response shape and citation structure.

For PDF generation, conversion, OCR, redaction, signing, watermarking, or any `/build`-based
workflow, use the sibling `document-processor-api` skill.

## Stored processors (feature-gated)

Tenants with the `data_extraction_processors` feature can run a stored processor instead of
supplying an inline schema:

```bash
uv run scripts/extract.py --input invoice.pdf --processor proc_... --out result.json
uv run scripts/extract.py --input invoice.pdf --processor proc_... \
  --processor-version latest --out result.json
```

`--processor-version` accepts an integer or `latest`. Processor mode is mutually exclusive with
`--schema`. The preflight cost estimate still applies, but it is approximate: the processor's
mode is not known locally, so the estimate uses the local `--mode` value (default
`understand`). The server's reported usage is authoritative.

Manage stored processors with `scripts/processors.py`:

```bash
uv run scripts/processors.py list
uv run scripts/processors.py create --config config.json [--name NAME] [--publish]
uv run scripts/processors.py show --processor proc_...
uv run scripts/processors.py rename --processor proc_... --name NAME
uv run scripts/processors.py delete --processor proc_...
uv run scripts/processors.py create-version --processor proc_... --config config.json
uv run scripts/processors.py show-version --processor proc_... --version 2
uv run scripts/processors.py publish-version --processor proc_... --version 2
```

The create and create-version JSON wrappers are inferred from the hosted API contract and
pinned in mocked tests. Live-smoke both operations on a feature-enabled tenant before release.

These commands require `data_extraction_processors`. If an uncoded feature-gated response is
returned, the management CLI reports that the feature may not be enabled for the tenant and
advises contacting Nutrient to enable it. A coded processor or version not-found error is
reported as not-found, not as evidence that the feature is off.

## Setup

DWS Extract is a separate product from DWS Processor and has its own API key.

- Get a Nutrient DWS Extract API key at <https://dashboard.nutrient.io/>.
- Export it as `NUTRIENT_EXTRACT_API_KEY`:
  ```bash
  export NUTRIENT_EXTRACT_API_KEY="pdf_live_..."
  ```
- Scripts live in `scripts/` relative to this SKILL.md. Use the directory containing this
  SKILL.md as the working directory:
  ```bash
  cd <directory containing this SKILL.md> && uv run scripts/<script>.py --help
  ```

Calling `/extraction/parse` with a DWS Processor key returns `403`. If your tenant has been
migrated to global DWS API keys, a single key set as either `NUTRIENT_EXTRACT_API_KEY` or
`NUTRIENT_API_KEY` will work for both products.

## `/extraction/parse` — one primitive, two output shapes

One call returns the full structural document model — typed elements with bounding boxes,
confidence scores, and reading order — or a whole-document Markdown string. You always
receive all element types in a single call.

### Picking a mode

Choose based on the user's intent and acceptable credit cost. All costs are
**extraction credits per page** — a separate billing bucket from the processor API
credits consumed by `/build`, `/sign`, OCR, and other DWS Processor endpoints.

**Principle — decide from the request alone; do not ask the user clarifying questions.**
Walk the checks below in order. Each rule that fires sets a minimum mode — the final
pick is the highest minimum across all rules that fired. If none fired, use the default
(rule 5).

1. **Explicit features named in the request** are non-negotiable.
   - Key-value pairs, form fields, semantic role classification (Title / SectionHeader /
     etc.), formulas, or handwriting → at minimum `understand` (9 cr/pg).
   - Alt text on pictures, charts, or diagrams → `agentic` (18 cr/pg).
2. **Document type implied by the request or filename.**
   - `form`, `invoice`, `receipt`, `application`, `claim` → likely contains key-value
     pairs → `understand`.
   - `chart`, `infographic`, or diagram-heavy doc + the user wants descriptions →
     `agentic`.
3. **OCR signal from filename or request** (`scanned`, `image-based`, `photographed`,
   `handwritten`, `screenshot`) → `structure` minimum; `text` mode silently fails on
   image-only input.
4. **Output format from intent.** RAG, search indexing, embeddings, or content migration
   → `markdown`. Layout overlay, per-element processing, or bounded extraction →
   `spatial`.
5. **No cues match anything above** → documented default `structure` + `spatial`
   (1.5 cr/pg). Handles both born-digital and scanned, gives bounded typed elements
   with table cells, never silently drops content.

| User intent | Mode | Output format | Cost | Notes |
|-------------|------|---------------|------|-------|
| RAG / search indexing / content migration — born-digital PDF | `text` | `markdown` | 1 cr/pg | Cheapest path; no OCR or AI needed |
| RAG / search indexing — scanned or image-based PDF | `structure` | `markdown` | 1.5 cr/pg | OCR required before Markdown assembly |
| Form / invoice — enumerate *all* key-value regions (no target schema) | `understand` | `spatial` | 9 cr/pg | AI key-value + table detection. For *named* fields ("the invoice number and total"), use `extract` instead |
| Layout-aware document understanding | `understand` | `spatial` | 9 cr/pg | Semantic paragraph roles (Title, SectionHeader, etc.) |
| Deep visual understanding (charts, diagrams, alt text) | `agentic` | `spatial` | 18 cr/pg | VLM adds alt descriptions on every picture element |
| **Default / ambiguous intent** | **`structure`** | **`spatial`** | **1.5 cr/pg** | Good balance: OCR + spatial elements, low cost |

**Confirm before running when the estimated cost exceeds 200 extraction credits** —
roughly 11 pages of `agentic`, 22 of `understand`, 133 of `structure`, or 200 of `text`.
Surface the estimate (`pages × cost_per_page`) and ask the operator to confirm before
invoking. Under that threshold, just run.

`mode='text'` is incompatible with `output_format='spatial'`; the client rejects the
combination before the network call.

### Invocation

```bash
# Default: structure mode, spatial output
uv run scripts/parse.py --input doc.pdf --out out.json

# Markdown for RAG (text mode — cheapest)
uv run scripts/parse.py --input doc.pdf --out out.md --output-format markdown --mode text

# Enumerate all key-value regions of a form (understand mode) — for NAMED fields use extract
uv run scripts/parse.py --input doc.pdf --out out.json --mode understand

# Agentic (VLM alt text on pictures)
uv run scripts/parse.py --input doc.pdf --out out.json --mode agentic
```

The script prints extraction-credit usage after each run so you can verify the cost.

### Downstream consumption

After a single `/parse` call, slice the response for common needs:

- **Reading-order plain text**: walk `output.elements` sorted by `(page.pageIndex, readingOrder)`, join `paragraph` and `handwriting` `text` fields
- **Tables**: project `cells[]` on each `table` element into rows/columns using `cell.row` and `cell.column`
- **Key-value pairs**: read `pairs[]` on each `keyValueRegion` element — each pair has `.key.value` and `.value.value`
- **Formulas**: read `latex` on each `formula` element
- **Pictures**: read `classification` and `altDescription` (populated by `agentic` mode) on each `picture` element
- **Markdown output**: call with `--output-format markdown`; the script writes the Markdown string directly

For the canonical response schema and per-mode field availability, see the official docs linked from `references/parse-output-filtering.md`; that file also lists the tools we suggest for filtering and reshaping the response.

### Input constraint

`parse.py` only accepts **local file paths** — the underlying API endpoint is
multipart-only. For remote inputs, download the file first.

## Rules

- Always preserve the printed credit-usage summary in script output so the operator can
  observe per-call cost.
- Do not add a URL-fetch shortcut; the endpoint is multipart-only.
